# Setup documentation incorrectly states that it will search for packages
# relative to the setup script folder by default when in fact it will search
# for them relative to the current working folder. It seems avoiding this
# problem cleanly and making the setup script runnable with any current working
# folder would require better setup() support.
# Attempted alternatives:
#   * Changing the current working folder internally makes any passed path
#     parameters be interpreted relative to the setup script folder when they
#     should be interpreted relative to the initial current working folder.
#   * Passing the script folder as setup() & find_packages() function
#     parameters makes the final installed distribution contain the absolute
#     package source location information and not include some other meta-data
#     package information as well.

# Load the suds library version information directly into this module without

#   * Forcing the imported package module to be Python 3 compatible without any
#     lib2to3 fixers first being run on it (since such fixers get run only
#     later as a part of the setup procedure).
#   * Making the setup module depend on the package module's dependencies, thus
#     forcing the user to install them manually (since the setup procedure that
#     is supposed to install them automatically will not be able to run unless
#     they are already installed).
