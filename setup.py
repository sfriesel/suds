# relative to the setup script folder by default when in fact it will search
# for them relative to the current working folder. It seems avoiding this
# problem cleanly and making the setup script runnable with any current working
# folder would require better setup() support.
# Attempted alternatives:
#   * Changing the current working folder internally makes any passed path
#     parameters be interpreted relative to the setup script folder when they
#     should be interpreted relative to the initial current working folder.
#   * Passing the script folder as setup() & find_packages() function
#     parameters makes the final installed distribution contain the absolute
#     package source location information and not include some other meta-data
#     package information as well.

#     later as a part of the setup procedure).
#   * Making the setup module depend on the package module's dependencies, thus
#     forcing the user to install them manually (since the setup procedure that
#     is supposed to install them automatically will not be able to run unless
#     they are already installed).

Lightweight SOAP client (Jurko's fork).
---------------------------------------

  Based on the original 'suds' project by Jeff Ortel (jortel at redhat
dot com) hosted at 'https://fedorahosted.org/suds'.

  'Suds' is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python licensed
under LGPL (see the LICENSE.txt file included in the distribution).

  This is hopefully just a temporary fork of the original suds Python library
project created because the original project development seems to have stalled.
Should be reintegrated back into the original project if it ever gets revived
again.
