GENERAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
=================================================

    * Testing.
        * 'pytest' testing framework needed to run unit tests.
        * To run the tests using Python 3 first process them and the rest of the
          library sources using the Python 2to3 conversion tool.

    * Base sources should remain Python 2.x compatible. Since the original
      project states aiming for Python 2.4 compatibility we should do so as
      well.

    * Python 3 related patches applicable to the original suds development
      project.
        * Should be first be added to the 'Python 3 support' branch and then
          merged back to the trunk from there.
        * Should be kept synchronized with the ones found in the Mercurial patch
          queue hosted at 'https://bitbucket.org/bernh/suds-python-3-patches'.
