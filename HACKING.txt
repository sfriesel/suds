GENERAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
=================================================

    * Project's sources accessible from a Mercurial version control repository
      hosted by BitBucket at 'https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds'.

    * Project development should be tracked in the TODO.txt file.
        * Exact formatting is not important as long as its contect is kept
          formatted consistently.
        * Done tasks should be marked as such and not deleted.

    * Testing.
        * 'pytest' testing framework needed to run unit tests.
        * To run the tests using Python 3 first process them and the rest of the
          library sources using the Python 2to3 conversion tool.

    * Base sources should remain Python 2.x compatible. Since the original
      project states aiming for Python 2.4 compatibility we should do so as
      well.
        * Compatibility notes.
            * 'with' statement first introduced in Python 2.5.

    * Handling Python 3 related patches applicable to the original suds
      development project.
        * Should be first be added to the 'Python 3 support' branch and then
          merged back to the trunk from there.
        * Should be kept synchronized with the ones found in the Mercurial patch
          queue hosted at 'https://bitbucket.org/bernh/suds-python-3-patches'.

RELEASE PROCEDURE:
=================================================

    * Document the release correctly in 'README.txt'.

    * Version identification.
        * Remove the '(development)' suffix for official release builds.
        * Format '<base-suds-version> jurko #'.
            * E.g. '0.4.1 jurko 1'.

    * Tag in Hg.
        * Name the tag like 'release-<version-info>'.
            * E.g. 'release-0.4.1 jurko 1'.

    * Prepare official releases based only on tagged commits.
        * Note.
            * Official releases should always be prepared based on tagged
              revisions with no local changes in the used sandbox.
        * Prepare source distribution packages (both .zip & .tar.bz2 formats),
          register the new release at PyPI and upload the prepared source
          packages.
            * Run 'setup.py sdist register upload'.
        * Upload the prepared source package to the project site.
            * Use the BitBucket project web interface.
        * Optionally archive the prepared source package locally.

    * Next development version identification.
        * Bump up the forked project version counter.
        * Add back the '(development)' suffix.
